How to run?
1)run drop.sql
2)run create.sql
3)run insert.sql
4)run python oltp_airline.py 100 5
5)run query to get final table: select * from final;

Notice:
1) total have 5 airplanes
2) flight_id=plane_id, thus to say each plane is dedicated to one flight.  also tickit.flight_id=final.plane_id
3) all the booked seats is in table Tickit
4) total seats are in table Plane
5) how many business seats are in table Flight


Queries to check the final table is correct:
1)check how many business class sold form table Tickit
select count(business_class) from tickit where flight_id=1 and business_class=1;   
2)check total earning from table Tickit
select sum(tickit_price) from tickit where flight_id=1;

How do I implement locking?
1) my program starts multiple threads, each thread generates random transaction on "Reservation"&&"Tickit"&&"Customer" 3 tables; 
   each transaction modify 3 tables;
2) each thread will generate a query randomly to book a seat, seat_number/seat_class/seat_price are random;
3) as time goes by, more tickits are sold out and there are more conflicts;
5) my program can catch each thread's progress, and commit if success or rollback if fail;
6) my program will show the reason of transaction failure;
